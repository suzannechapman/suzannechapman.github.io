The University of Illinois Library website is a large legacy site that developed organically over many years with thousands of pages of content written by hundreds of people. As part of the effort to move to a new platform, redesign, and develop new content, I established a new UX program with a set of resources to support the migration process. 
* Led website vision, design, information architecture, content strategy, user research, and assessment activities.
* Developed content style guide and audit rubric to help content authors and subject matter experts assess (and cull) their current content and learn the new guidelines.
* Performed project strategy duties to drive functionality, goals, requirements, priorities, and communication between developers, users, and internal stakeholders.
