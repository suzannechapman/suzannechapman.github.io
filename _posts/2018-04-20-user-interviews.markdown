Prior to launching a full website redesign for the U-M Library website, I wanted to conduct some qualitative user research to help inform the design and problem-solving process. As chair of the Usability Group, I led two studies to better understand how novice and experienced users interact with the library website, what services they value, and what they find challenging. Experienced users were interviewed and asked to walk us through their process while novice users were observed remotely.
