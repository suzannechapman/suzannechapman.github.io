The U-M Library does a great deal of in-house development and supports hundreds of websites and other digital assets. I introduced new project strategies to guide, better structure, ensure a holistic and user-centered focus to projects, and improve communication. For example:

* Guiding Principles statement to establish a new philosophy.
* Project charters to help identify stakeholders, problem statement, scope, goals, timeline, etc.
* Project prioritization to weigh effort and impact and weighted goal matrices to compare project ideas to goals.
* Project debrief process to assess how well project was executed and where improvements can be made to processes.
* Project intake workflows and quality assurance guidelines.
