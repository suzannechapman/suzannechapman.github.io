In 2010, I identified a need for the University of Michigan Library to dedicate more resources to the design and usability of the hundreds of websites and access systems developed in-house. I advocated for – and then launched – a new User Experience Department.

* Established department and developed departmental mission.
* Managed overall vision, strategies, and tasks for department projects.
* Consulted with other libraries interested in creating a UX program.
* Trained library staff on user-focused strategies and advocated for data-driven decisions.
