The U-M Library Undergraduate Library holds a very popular event each fall to welcome new students and welcome back returning students. I decided to use this opportunity to provide a fun activity for the students, capture their energy and enthusiasm, while also gathering a little information, in the students own words, about what they value in a library. Results helped paint a picture of students' interests ranging from digital access to physical spaces and actual books.

Students were given a piece of card stock emblazoned with “My ideal library… ______ ” and were then asked to fill in the blank and pose for a photograph with it.
