During the discovery phase of the University of Michigan Library's website redesign project, I took a close look at the thousands of pages of content and discovered some major improvements were needed. 
Led effort to shift content creation to be less distributed and to focus more on user needs.
* Managed the retirement of over 1,200 unnecessary, outdated, or redundant pages.
* Advocated for the creation of a new Web Content Strategist position; supervised the creation of new policies, workflows, and quality standards; supervised the activities to retire additional unnecessary pages, improve high-value content and create new content to address gaps.
* Established a new Web Content Coordinator role within each of the 8 library divisions and co-managed this group.
